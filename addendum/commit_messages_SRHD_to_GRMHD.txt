07d3d23 Implemented GRMHD equations for the case of having a network that outputs the quantity `x = hW`, the latter output which I still have to implemetn.

2ac2b88 Confirmed that the model can still train properly. The test norm errors remain to be below the train norm errors. I will now venture into loading the data from a csv file.
139a514 Confirmed correct operation of the c++ code with the eight input parameters version of the code.
784288a Fixed the issue; I had to unsqueeze the input. The problem further lied in that I was simply skipping the cell that runned the same thing for `net`. I have yet to reconfirm the C++ part which I will do on arch.  I will next fix the assertion error by squeezing the input in _Porting to C++_ and I will make sure that I do a similar unsqueeze in C++.

e2c4ec4 Completed the modification of the equations and the addition of the three magnetic field inputs---at least using dummy sampling intervals [0,1] for B^k and b^mu. Changed MSE plot to plot loss_name instead.

9f9fbdc Adjusted the rest of the code for the addition of the GR magnetic field primitives and thereby conservative variables. Removed remaining NAN_TO_NUM if-block. Now we are to change all the equations to those found in Gram-x. The code is now ready for the addition of the GRMHD equations. The next step is to add the GRMHD equations and then test the code.
3db19bb Changing the equations according to Gram-X. Changed the magnetic field to be last as in Gram-X; this entails changing the order of arguments to the data generation code and to the return valeus of the functions. I likewise moved epsilon to the front. Tau I kept at the place it is for correspondence with Gram-X. I have yet to continue editing the equations and have to propagate through the changes beyond the definitons of the functions too.

ab5bac1 Added in magnetic field which is being sampled uniformly on `[0,1]` in all directions until I find a better value for it. Changed old `gamma` to `Gamma` so that I can add new `gamma` the determinant of `gamma_ij`. Note that at this point I still need to adjust the equations from the form of Dieselhorst et al. to the form of Gram-X.

56e1a3d Inclusion ofthe  three-dimensional velocity, without nan-values afaik. If this is indeed so,  I can continue to remove the nan-value handling code, and I can continue to neglect the ca2_nan_fixed code of colab. Now as we can see in the output of `conversion_attempt_2.ipynb`, the same hyperparameters give an error that is worse, and we envision that we have to retrain the model. This we will do next, and then we continue on with the work of _Meeting notes_ (2023-05-17 16:48:54). While we are at it, or after it, or before it, whatever works, we remove the nan-value handling code that we created, and continue. We have removed SMALL_CONSTANT from the equation already.
